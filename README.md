# PortfolioProject-Bootstrap

## What this project is
This is my second attempt at creating a repository for all of my past, current, and future projects. This time I use bootstrap instead of CSS styling.

## Why I began this project
I would eventually like to have a dedicated space to showcase all of my projects to potential clients and employers, and this portfolio is my way of doing that.

## How I implemented this project
I used a combination of HTML and CSS styling to create the webpage portfolio.

## What I hope to eventually accomplish with this project
I would like to have individual sections for topics such as my own personal biography, educational and professional background, list of works, etc.
